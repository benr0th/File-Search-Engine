# File-Search-Engine

A file search program using PySimpleGUI. Uses Pickle to index a select filepath, then searches for files or folders in that filepath and outputs the search results. You can open results in the file explorer by highlighting the filepath and right clicking or pressing a button.

Requires PySimpleGUI. Recommended to have its own folder as it creates a file_index.pkl file when an index is created.
